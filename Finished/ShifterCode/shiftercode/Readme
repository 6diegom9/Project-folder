Has auto configure to take into account slope of the car and neutral position of the shifter. 
Currently set up to unlock car at 3rd gear when activated 3 times.

Project will be completed when I have a project car (cheap honda civic) to tune up and try out CAN bus modifications.
Will also require 3d printed part to hold on to the shifter and pcb design to accomadate for the minimal room.
